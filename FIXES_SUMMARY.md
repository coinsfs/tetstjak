# WebSocket Implementation Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0') in AuthContext.tsx at line 123

## Root Cause
The error was occurring because the code was trying to access `user.user_roles[0]` without checking if `user.user_roles` existed or had any elements.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. AuthContext.tsx - WebSocket Connection Management
- Added proper checks before accessing `user.user_roles[0]`
- Implemented fallback to default 'user' role when user_roles is undefined or empty
- Applied the same fix in three locations:
  1. Initial authentication setup useEffect
  2. WebSocket connection management useEffect
  3. Login function
  4. Refresh user function

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Before (problematic):
websocketService.setUserInfo(user._id, user.user_roles[0]);

// After (fixed):
const userRole = user.user_roles && user.user_roles.length > 0 ? user.user_roles[0] : 'user';
websocketService.setUserInfo(user._id, userRole);
```

## WebSocket Heartbeat Implementation Status
The WebSocket heartbeat implementation is working correctly with the following features:

1. **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Sends heartbeat messages every 50 seconds
2. **Server Communication**: Properly handles heartbeat acknowledgments and server pings
3. **Reconnection Logic**: Implements exponential backoff with max 30-second delay
4. **Role-Based Timeouts**: 
   - Students/Teachers: 5 minutes (300 seconds) inactivity timeout
   - Admin: 10 minutes (600 seconds) inactivity timeout
5. **Message Format**: Standardized JSON messages with required fields

## Testing
- Development server starts successfully without errors
- WebSocket connections establish properly
- Heartbeat messages are sent at the correct intervals
- Reconnection logic works as expected

## Files Modified
1. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed user role access issues
2. `src/services/websocket.ts` - Implemented heartbeat mechanism
3. `src/components/dashboards/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Added heartbeat message handlers
4. `src/components/security/ExamMonitoring.tsx` - Removed duplicate heartbeat mechanism
5. `src/components/dashboards/student/pages/StudentExamTakingPage.tsx` - Removed duplicate heartbeat mechanism

The implementation now properly handles edge cases where user roles might be undefined or empty, preventing the TypeError that was occurring before.
