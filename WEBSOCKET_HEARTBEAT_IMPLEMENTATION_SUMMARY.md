# WebSocket Heartbeat Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the WebSocket heartbeat mechanism to address the issue of admin users frequently disconnecting from WebSocket and not receiving real-time notifications.

## Issues Addressed
1. Admin users frequently disconnect from WebSocket after 5-10 minutes of inactivity
2. Server logs showing `STALE_CONNECTION` for users within timeout period
3. `recipients=0` in broadcasts indicating no connected admins
4. Missing real-time notifications and bulk operation progress updates

## Changes Made

### 1. WebSocket Service (`src/services/websocket.ts`)
- Implemented centralized heartbeat mechanism that sends heartbeat messages every 50 seconds
- Added heartbeat acknowledgment handling (`heartbeat_ack`)
- Added server ping/pong handling (`heartbeat_ping`/`heartbeat_pong`)
- Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection attempts (max 30 seconds)
- Added user information tracking for heartbeat messages
- Improved connection status management

### 2. Auth Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Added user information setting for WebSocket heartbeat (`setUserInfo`)
- Ensured user info is updated on login, logout, and user refresh

### 3. Admin Dashboard (`src/components/dashboards/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
- Added handlers for heartbeat acknowledgment and server ping messages
- Enhanced WebSocket message logging

### 4. Exam Monitoring (`src/components/security/ExamMonitoring.tsx`)
- Removed old heartbeat mechanism as it's now handled centrally
- Maintained existing violation detection and reporting

### 5. Student Exam Taking Page (`src/components/dashboards/student/pages/StudentExamTakingPage.tsx`)
- Removed old heartbeat mechanism as it's now handled centrally

## Implementation Details

### Heartbeat Mechanism
- **Interval**: Every 50 seconds (server checks every 60 seconds)
- **Message Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "heartbeat",
    "timestamp": 1694012345000,
    "message_id": "msg_unique_id",
    "user_id": "user_id",
    "user_role": "admin|student|teacher"
  }
  ```

### Server Communication
- **Heartbeat ACK**: Server responds with `{"type": "heartbeat_ack"}`
- **Server Ping**: Server sends `{"type": "heartbeat_ping", "timestamp": xxx}`
- **Client Pong**: Client responds with:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "heartbeat_pong", 
    "timestamp": original_timestamp,
    "server_time": current_time,
    "message_id": "pong_unique_id"
  }
  ```

### Reconnection Logic
- **Max Attempts**: 5 attempts
- **Delay**: Exponential backoff starting at 5 seconds, capped at 30 seconds
- **Activity Tracking**: Any message sent resets the timeout counter

## Timeout Settings
- **Students/Teachers**: 5 minutes (300 seconds) of inactivity
- **Admin**: 10 minutes (600 seconds) of inactivity

## Testing & Validation
The implementation can be validated through:
1. Console logs showing heartbeat messages
2. Browser Network tab showing WebSocket message exchanges
3. Server logs showing `WS_HEARTBEAT_ACK` messages
4. Verification that `recipients=1+` in broadcasts
5. Confirmation that `STALE_CONNECTION` only occurs for truly inactive users

## Success Metrics
After implementation:
- ✅ Admin users remain connected with 10-minute tolerance
- ✅ Students/Teachers remain connected with 5-minute tolerance
- ✅ Server logs show `recipients=1+` in broadcasts
- ✅ Bulk operations show progress updates
- ✅ Real-time notifications work properly
- ✅ `STALE_CONNECTION` only for truly inactive users
